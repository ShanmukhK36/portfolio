        <p>Hi, I’m Shanmukh Katakam, a dynamic Java Developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience in designing and building scalable, enterprise-level applications. I specialize in modern Java frameworks, cloud technologies, and Agile methodologies to deliver high-impact business solutions.</p>        
        <p>I began my career at Vivma Software Inc, where I led key initiatives in developing an Order Management System and an Inventory Management Module. My focus was on backend development using Spring Boot and Hibernate, orchestrating microservices with Docker, and deploying solutions on Azure. These efforts helped streamline operations and enhance the customer experience.</p>
        <p>Later, I joined PNC, Texas, stepping into a more strategic role. There, I was instrumental in modernizing banking platforms, developing high-performance REST APIs using Java 11, and improving transaction efficiency through hybrid database integrations. My contributions led to a 25% reduction in service incidents and a 40% improvement in deployment efficiency.</p>
        <p>I’m particularly skilled in Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Docker, Jenkins, MongoDB, and AWS, with practical exposure to React, Node.js, and TypeScript, making me adaptable in both backend and full-stack environments. I'm also a strong advocate of CI/CD practices and Agile development.</p>
        <p>Academically, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Technology from Amrita Viswa Vidyapeetham, India, and I’m currently pursuing my Master of Science in Applied Statistics and Data Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, with graduation expected in December 2024.</p>
